# Bachelor's Degree thesis in Computer Engineering: Control of electromechanical devices using brain computer interface.

Written by Anabel Díaz Labrador

## Description
This repository contains the report for my Bachelor's Degree thesis in Computer Engineering, focused on developing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that utilizes Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP). The main objective of the thesis is to propose and analyze the feasibility of controlling electromechanical devices—such as servomotors and levers—by detecting and interpreting brain signals.

You can access the full report in [RIULL ULL Database](https://riull.ull.es/xmlui/handle/915/34032).


Please note that this repository specifically contains the LaTeX source code for the thesis document. It is based on the 2021 version of the Overleaf compiler. It does not include the other project files or additional materials related to the thesis.

The work accomplished is divided in two parts:
- ROS nodes
- Unity project
